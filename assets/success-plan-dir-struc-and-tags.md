## Success Plan - Directory Structure and Tags

Note: I recommend that you rename this file to "_Tag Directory" or something with "_" so that it stays at the top in the File Explorer.

### Directory Structure

There is a Success Plan directory and four directory inside of it that pertain to each of the different items that are a part of the Success Plan.

Success Plan
- Goals
- Key Results
- Projects
- Tasks
