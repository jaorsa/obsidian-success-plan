> This plugin was developed by [Joshwin Greene](https://github.com/joshwingreene) in collaboration with [Conrad Lin](https://conradlin.com/) (Designer of the Success Plan Framework) and the [Co-x3 Family](https://join.co-x3.com/). If you would like to show Joshwin your appreciation, you can do so by buying him a [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/joshwingreene). If you are a fan of what Conrad, Joshwin, and the rest of the Co-x3 Family are doing, please support us by becoming a one-time or monthly [Patron](https://toolbox.co-x3.com/support-us). Also, if you are interested in being a part of a community of co-creators and collaborators, then we would be happy to have you. [Learn More](https://join.co-x3.com/community).

This plugin offers capabilities that follow #theGamificationProject's Success Plan by Conrad Lin.

It allows you to manage your tasks, projects, key results, and goals within Obsidian. In the next release, you will also be able to push your wins (completed objectives) to the [Make Work Fun](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/make-work-fun-gamify-notion-workspaces) app, which is the Co-x3 Family's solution to multiplayer for personal development. We recently open-sourced the [code](https://github.com/thex3family/make-work-fun) (with limitations)!

This plugin relies on markdown files that have the following format:

![Markdown Preview](https://github.com/joshwingreene/obsidian-success-plan/blob/main/assets/images/task-markdown-preview.png)

When the Make Work Fun integration is online, you will be able to share wins with the Co-x3 Family by changing an item's status to "Complete" and choosing the "Share with Family" option. When this is done, it will be pushed to Make Work Fun.

After you have shared the win, you will see the win in the "Recent Wins" table on your player page. Here's an example of what you can expect:
