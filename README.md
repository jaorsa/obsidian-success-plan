> This plugin was developed by [Joshwin Greene](https://github.com/joshwingreene) in collaboration with [Conrad Lin](https://conradlin.com/)(Designer of the Success Plan Framework) and the [Co-x3 Family](https://join.co-x3.com/). If you would like to show Joshwin your appreciation, you can do so by buying him a [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/joshwingreene). If you are a fan of what Conrad, Joshwin, and the rest of the Co-x3 Family are doing, please support us by becoming a one-time or monthly [Patron](https://toolbox.co-x3.com/support-us). Also, if you are interested in being a part of a community of co-creators and collaborators, then we would be happy to have you. [Learn More](https://join.co-x3.com/community)

This plugin offers capabilities that follow the #theGamificationProject's Success Plan by Conrad Lin.

It allows you to manage your tasks, projects, key results, and goals within Obsidian. You can also push your wins to the [Make Work Fun](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/make-work-fun-gamify-notion-workspaces) app, which is the Co-x3 Community's solution to multiplayer for personal development.

It relies on markdown files that have the following format:

You can share wins with the Co-x3 community by changing an item's status to "Complete" and choosing the "Share with Family" option. When this is done, it will be push to Make Work Fun over a series of steps. Here's a diagram on how it gets from Obsidian to Make Work Fun:
